# Welcome to Sewrly, your trusty sewing planner!

Plan your sewing projects and keep track of the current states they are in.

## Make sewing more sustainable and keep your storage room clean

Use the shopping list to always know what you still need (and what you don't need), and the fabric calculator to have enough for your project but never too much scrap.

## Your second sewing brain

Use the project detail pages to keep notes. Scroll through the archive to remind yourself of a trick you've learned along the way or of the temperature the garment wants to be washed at.

### Lot's more to come! This is just the beginning.

Follow this space and don't miss new features, for example a checkbox material list to keep better track of what you have and what you still need for a project.

# Happy Sewing!
